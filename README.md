# Underlying Factors that Contribute to University Dropout Rates

## Overview
Utilizes a Kaggle dataset containing 36 features about student demographics including gender, ethnicity, previous qualifications,
grades, etc. This  project does a machine learning analysis to infer the factors that contribute most to university dropout rates
which is a target of the dataset marked with values of graduated, enrolled, or dropped out.

## Comparison of Models
- ### Random Forest
  
  This model can perform regression or classification; however, in this case, it was used to classify a student as successful in
  completing university or not.
  
- ### K-Nearest Neighbors

  Classifies observations by looking at the k closest data points nearby
  
- ### Logistic Regression

  Determines the probability of a target given a set of features
  
- ## Neural Network

  Analyzes complex, non-linear, or multi-faceted data well. Assigns weight to inputs and moves them through an activation
  function to predict outputs in each perceptron.

## Analysis and Data Visualization
The report attached does a deep dive into the findings of the data including model performance, factors that contribute most to
student success for university completion, and data visualizations.
